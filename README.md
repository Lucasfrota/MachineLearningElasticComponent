# javaMachineLearning

This project aims to be an easy and reusable way to use supervised machine learning techniques. To generate a knowledge model it is required to have a .arff file and specify its path in the constructor method just as the index of the predictive class. then if you want to classify a new register to obtain a prediction of its class you'll use the classifier method, its parameter is a List of Objects which has to contain the features of your new register
